# Extraction Project

## Overview

This project explores and tests different authentication methods for APIs, focusing primarily on OAuth and API Key mechanisms. The goal is to evaluate how these authentication types can be implemented and integrated into API extraction workflows.

## Objectives

- Test and compare OAuth and API Key authentication methods.
- Demonstrate secure API access and data extraction.
- Provide example implementations for both authentication types.

## Features

- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- API Key authentication
- Sample scripts for API data extraction


## Requirements

- Python 3.x (or your preferred language)
- Requests library (for Python examples)
- API credentials (OAuth client ID/secret or API Key)

## Usage

Refer to the provided scripts and documentation for step-by-step guides on authenticating and extracting data from APIs using both OAuth and API Key methods.
